The only project I had been working on during the past year in C++ to familiarize myself with the language. The assignment was taken from an advanced programming class a friend had taken, and involved filling in a "skeleton" to eventually create a limited functioning terminal shell. The majority of the implemented code can be found within "inode.cpp" and "commands.cpp". This assignment was primarily an exercise in familiarizing myself with pointers and vectors.
